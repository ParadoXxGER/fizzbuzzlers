# Array manipulation (simple)

Implement a "ArrayManipulator" class with the following functionality:

1. Find the minimum value in a list
2. Find the maximum value in a list
3. Calculate a remainder (given a numerator and denominator)
4. Return distinct values from a list including duplicates (i.e. "1 3 5 3 7 3 1 1 5" -> "1 3 5 7")
5. Return distinct values and their counts (i.e. the list above becomes "1(3) 3(3) 5(2) 7(1)")
